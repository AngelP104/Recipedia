            <h1>How to Seed and Dice a Bell Pepper</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Submitted by Ángel Pardo</h3>
            <p>
                Bell peppers, versatile in salads and stir-fries, can be a bit tricky to prepare with their seeds and
                membranes. To start, choose a firm and vibrant bell pepper. If it's too soft, the cutting process becomes
                messier and more challenging.
            </p>

            <h2>Method</h2>

            <p>
                Begin by placing the bell pepper on a cutting board. Slice off the top and bottom to create stable, flat
                surfaces. With the pepper standing upright, carefully make a vertical cut along one side to expose the
                internal cavity. Gently open the pepper, revealing the seeds and membranes attached to the core. Using a
                knife, carefully cut around the core, detaching it from the pepper's flesh.
                <br><br>
                Once removed, you'll have two
                large sections and a core with seeds. Lay each section flat and slice lengthwise into strips, then crosswise
                for diced pieces. For the core, extract any remaining usable parts by carefully trimming away the flesh.
                Following this method ensures quick and efficient bell pepper preparation for your culinary endeavors.
