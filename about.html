        <p>
            Hello there, fellow food enthusiasts! I'm Ángel, <strong>a budding chef with a heart full of
                passion</strong> and a
            kitchen brimming with exciting experiments. Welcome to my little corner of the culinary world, where
            <em>simplicity</em> meets <em>deliciousness</em>.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Picture me as your culinary companion—a starter cook with a hunger for sharing the joy of homemade goodness.
            My kitchen is a playground where the aroma of spices, the sizzle of pans, and the joy of creation come
            together to craft unforgettable meals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In my world, cooking is all about embracing simplicity. No need for complex techniques or hard-to-pronounce
            ingredients. I'm all about using familiar pantry staples to create dishes that are not only easy to make but
            also bursting with flavor. Think of it as a celebration of the extraordinary in the everyday.
